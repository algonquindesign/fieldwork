### The Event

The Grad Show is usually held the last week of Fieldwork. This year, that would be {{ site.data.course-info.grad-show-date }}.

### Fundraising

The Grad Show is a self-funded event organized by students in the framework of this course. All students are expected to participate in fundraising activities. These activities may include:

<ul class="columns3">
	<li>Mobile bake sales</li>
	<li>Pub nights</li>
	<li>Hand lettering event</li>
	<li>Poster sales</li>
	<li>Card sales</li>
	<li>GoFundMe page</li>
	<li>Speed portfolio dating</li>
	<li>Online bidding for donated items</li>
	<li>Movie night</li>
	<li>Paint night</li>
</ul>

The Student Association also contributes about $1000, or about $20 per graduating student. It could be more, it's up to you to enquire what funds are available from the S.A.

<!-- #### Expenses

The rental fee for the Horticulture Building is about $2500 for the evening. There are other event costs. We generally want to fundraise over $3000. It's a good idea to leave some money behind for potential future program project funding. -->

### Team Workings & Functions

Every member of this class should be a member of at least one team but can also be on every team they have time/interest in. Each team will agree on a team lead.

If issues arise within a team, they are managed within the team under the direction of the team lead. If the issue cannot be resolved, it can be escalated to the chairs. If it still is not resolved, it is brought to Alain.

Teams are expected to collaborate. For instance, if the Motion Team needs brand graphics to use in After Effects, they'll request them with specifications from the Branding Team.

#### Grad Show Chairs

Two people are elected to oversee all activities as well as coordinate and attend meetings with team leads. They meet with Alain to provide progress updates.

Chairs may opt out of participating in any teams. They act as overseers of and liaisons between all the teams leads and report to Alain.

#### Team Leads

Team leads are managers of the teams. They're not the ones doing all the work. They delegate and do their part of the work. They ensure that everyone in the team does their fair share of work. If someone's not pulling their weight, Alain finds out...

#### Web Site Team

This team works with the Web Design teacher to build the web site for the graduating cohort. See last year's <a href="https://2022.grads.algonquindesign.ca" title="2021 Grad Web Site" target="_blank">grad site here</a>.

#### Branding Team
